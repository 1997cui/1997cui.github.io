I am a Ph.D. student in Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Arvind Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind). 

My research interests are Systems, Computer Networking and Computer Architecture.

## Education
 * 2018/08 - Present: Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Washington
 * 2014/09 - 2018/08: B.S. in Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China

## Internship & Visiting Research
* 2017/10-2018/8 Microsoft Research Asia, Advisor: Lintao Zhang
   
  During this internship, I figured out why current Linux Socket is slow and non-scalable and designed a new system to improve the performance of Linux Socket while keeping it compatible with existing APIs.

* 2017/07-2017/09 UCLA CSST Program, Advisor: Jason Cong
  
  During the summer, I explored methods to simplify programming for hardware developers and found out that Go programming language is suitable for developers due to its unique feature.

 * 2016/07 - 2016/08: Microsoft Research Asia, Advisor: Kun Tan

   I developed a RSA accelerator with [ClickNP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/main-4.pdf).

## Hobbies

I have a broad interest in variable sports and activities, but I can play none of them pretty well. :) Below are some examples.

 * Swimming
 * Skiing
