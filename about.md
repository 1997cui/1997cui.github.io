I am a Ph.D. student in Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Arvind Krishnamurthy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/arvind). 

My research interests are Systems, Computer Networking and Computer Architecture.

* 2020/07-2020/12 Microsoft Research, Advisor: [Wei Bai](https://baiwei0427.github.io/)

  During the Internship, I worked with Microsoft Azure to improve RDMA performance by tuning switch RDMA parameters on [SONiC](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/sonic-the-networking-switch-software-that-powers-the-microsoft-global-cloud/).

* 2017/10-2018/8 Microsoft Research Asia, Advisor: [Lintao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BSa0rkwAAAAJ)
   
  During this internship, I figured out why current Linux Socket is slow and non-scalable and designed a new system to improve the performance of Linux Socket while keeping it compatible with existing APIs.

* 2017/07-2017/09 UCLA CSST Program, Advisor: [Jason Cong](https://vast.cs.ucla.edu/people/faculty/jason-cong)
  
  During the summer, I explored methods to simplify programming for hardware developers and found out that Go programming language is suitable for developers due to its unique feature.

 * 2016/07 - 2016/08: Microsoft Research Asia, Advisor: [Kun Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kun-tan-7993b114/)

   I developed a RSA accelerator with [ClickNP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/main-4.pdf).
